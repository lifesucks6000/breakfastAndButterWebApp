# Bookings and Reservations

This is the repository for my bookings and reservations project.

-- Below is a list of all the important libs that I have used.

- Build in Go version 1.20
- Uses the [Chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
- Uses [alex edwards SCS](https://github.com/alexedwards/scs/v2) session manager
- Uses [nosurf](https://github.com/justinas/nosurf)

Thanks for being such a good sport :3
